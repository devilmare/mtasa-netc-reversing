# Understanding the Basics of Networking and Anti-Cheat in MTA:SA

## (Important Point) Reason for this Post

- **This post is intended for educational purposes** and to provide _information and concepts_ about the game's mechanics.
- **Main Purpose**: To help those interested in improving their experience and expanding their knowledge of networking and security within games.
- **Not intended** to publish sensitive content or encourage cheating on official servers.
- I bear no responsibility for any consequences arising from the use of the information, as the game is subject to strict rules and potential penalties.
- **Use the information for positive purposes**: to uncover vulnerabilities, learn, and develop, not to abuse or attack.

## 1. The main component for network management and security: `netc.dll`

`netc.dll`** is the core library in MTA:SA, combining:

- __RakNet__: The networking library responsible for:
- Initializing and opening connections over UDP/TCP
- Session management, retransmission (ACK/NACK), and ensuring packet order
- Additional features such as NAT Punchthrough and data compression

- __SharedUtil__ (from the open source **mta-blue** project):
- `SString`, `WString`: Text classes for handling ASCII and Unicode
- `BitStream`: A class for encoding and decoding data before transmission
- Other uses

- __Anti-Cheat Engine__: Includes internal and external interfaces to prevent game modification and track cheaters

## 2. External Anti-Cheat – Kernel Mode
Operates at the kernel level via a signed driver definition:

1. Monitor DLL injections and hooks within game memory.
2. Intercept calls such as CreateProcess, OpenProcess, and ZwProtectVirtualMemory to prevent memory tampering.
3. Scan code sections to detect strange code or code loaded from unknown paths.
4. Analyze call stacks to detect any unauthorized calls within game functions.
5. IRP Callback Hooks: Intercept I/O requests to files and devices to detect external cheats.

Objectives:
- Block cheats at the system level.
- Prevent circumvention of security measures in user mode.
- Detecting reverse engineering attempts.

## 3. Internal Anti-Cheat – User Mode
Interacts directly within the game code (User Mode) to protect the internal logic:

- **Integrity Validation**:
- __Checksum Validation__: Periodically reads Checksum values ​​on memory segments.
- __ValidatePacket__, __ValidateRPC__: Functions for checking the integrity of packets and RPC requests.

- **Encrypted Pointers**:
- Using XOR operations to protect struct pointers.

- **Dynamic Memory Scanning**:
- Searches for known cheat code patterns within dynamic sections.

- **Sandboxing**:
- Running some functions in isolated memory regions to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Serial Tracking**:
- Protect and read the generated serial number to prevent it from being changed.

- **Tamper Protection**:
- Protect the user from data tampering such as packets, etc.
